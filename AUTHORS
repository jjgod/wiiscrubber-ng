The following comes from the original WiiScrubber:

Thanks to:
1. Waninkoko for releasing the source of the WiiFrii code as it originally allowed
   me to implement the Trucha bits.

2. Stormyuan for lots of unintentional bug testing :)

3. Everyone else involved in testing at different stages.

4. Eric Young for the SHA code from openssl.


Besides that:

Thanks to Arep for FriiDump. Some of the code used by this program, as well as
most of its build system come from FriiDump.

Other minor pieces of code were taken from tcpdump (www.tcpdump.org), Python
(www.python.org) and the glibc printf manpage.

Thanks to the ConsoleTribe staff for giving me the possibility to use their
forum for the program support.

Finally, obvious thanks go out to Nintendo for making all of their great
consoles, who constantly help me to waste the rest of my spare time I do not
spend coding ;).
